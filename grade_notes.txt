Design Documentation (10/20)
============================

Missing interaction diagram (you have things you call interaction
diagrams, but they don't look like the interaction diagrams we showed in
class and that are used in the book).

I assume your "Big Diagram" is intended to be a class diagram, but it
doesn't show any of the relationships between classes, like a proper class
diagram would.


Software Design (20/30)
=======================

As you currently have it, a bonus word is any valid word that's longer than
4 characters.  The intent was for bonus words to be "rare" words, not
"long" words.  It's not clear how you'd be able to support this intent
without a lot of changes.

Related, it's not clear how you'd add different word kinds without a lot of
changes. Currently separate word lists are initialized in
initializeWordLists, and then those lists are hard-coded into isValidWord.

Testing (10/10)
===============

Looks ok.

Release C Planning (5/5)
========================

No Issues or Milestones on your repo, but otherwise looks like a pretty
well-thought-out plan for the next release.
